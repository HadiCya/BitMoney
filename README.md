Non-Personal Information
We may collect non-personal information such as device type, operating system, and usage statistics in order to improve the app's functionality and user experience. This information is collected in an anonymous and aggregate form and is used solely for internal purposes.

Sharing of Information
We do not share any data with third parties or use it for marketing or advertising purposes. Any information you provide while using the BitMoney app will remain strictly confidential and will not be shared or sold.

Security
We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no security measures are 100% effective, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information.
